# Fixes Implemented - Telegram Travel Bot

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Application Sending Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Applications were failing to send with error message: "–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–∞ –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–µ –∑–∞—è–≤–∫–∏"
- Root cause: `MissingGreenlet` SQLAlchemy error
- The synchronous `generate_excel()` function was being called in an async context without proper handling

**Solution:**
- Added `asyncio` import to handlers
- Wrapped `generate_excel()` call with `asyncio.to_thread()` to safely execute synchronous code in async context
- This prevents the SQLAlchemy greenlet error and ensures proper async/sync handling

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Before:
excel_path = generate_excel(excel_data)

# After:
excel_path = await asyncio.to_thread(generate_excel, excel_data)
```

**File Modified:** `bot/handlers/application.py`

### 2. Draft-Saving Functionality - IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Draft-saving was not working properly
- Code was trying to use `draft.id` before flushing the session, causing participant association failures

**Solution:**
- Fixed the `save_draft()` function to properly flush the session before accessing `draft.id`
- Added support for updating existing drafts
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Integrated with existing "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" menu button

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Session Flush:** Added `await session.flush()` after creating draft to ensure ID is available
2. **Draft Update Support:** Check if `draft_id` exists in state and update existing draft instead of creating new one
3. **Proper Participant Management:** Delete old participants before adding new ones when updating drafts
4. **Better User Messages:** Updated success message to direct users to "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" menu

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Added session.flush() before using draft.id
session.add(draft)
await session.flush()  # IMPORTANT: Get draft.id before adding participants

# Support for updating existing drafts
if draft_id:
    # Update existing draft
    result = await session.execute(
        select(Application).where(...)
    )
    draft = result.scalar_one_or_none()
    # Update fields...
else:
    # Create new draft
    draft = Application(...)
```

**File Modified:** `bot/handlers/application.py`

## Features Already Implemented (No Changes Needed)

### Draft Viewing & Management
- **Location:** `bot/handlers/drafts.py`
- **Features:**
  - View all saved drafts with details
  - Load draft to continue editing
  - Delete unwanted drafts
  - Proper filtering by user and draft status

### Draft Loading & Editing
- Users can load drafts and continue from where they left off
- All draft data is properly restored to FSM state
- Seamless transition to participants menu

### Main Menu Integration
- "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" button available in main menu
- Proper access control for approved users only

---

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- Using existing `Application` model with `status = ApplicationStatus.DRAFT`
- Participants are properly associated via foreign key
- Automatic timestamps for created_at and updated_at

### State Management
- Draft ID is stored in FSM state when loading a draft
- This allows seamless updates when saving changes
- State is cleared after successful save or submit

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. Application Submission
- [ ] Fill out application form completely
- [ ] Submit application
- [ ] Verify Excel file is generated correctly
- [ ] Verify email is sent successfully
- [ ] Check no errors in bot logs

#### 2. Draft Creation
- [ ] Start filling out application
- [ ] Click "üíæ –°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫" at confirmation step
- [ ] Verify success message with draft ID
- [ ] Check draft appears in "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" menu

#### 3. Draft Loading
- [ ] Open "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" menu
- [ ] Select "‚úèÔ∏è –ü—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç—å" for a draft
- [ ] Verify all data is loaded correctly
- [ ] Verify can continue editing

#### 4. Draft Updating
- [ ] Load an existing draft
- [ ] Make changes (add/remove participants, etc.)
- [ ] Save draft again
- [ ] Verify changes are persisted
- [ ] Verify no duplicate drafts created

#### 5. Draft to Submission
- [ ] Load a draft
- [ ] Complete any remaining fields
- [ ] Submit as final application
- [ ] Verify draft is converted to submitted application
- [ ] Verify draft no longer appears in drafts list

#### 6. Draft Deletion
- [ ] Open "üíæ –ú–æ–∏ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏" menu
- [ ] Click "üóëÔ∏è –£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å" for a draft
- [ ] Verify draft is deleted
- [ ] Verify confirmation message

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add bot/handlers/application.py
   git commit -m "Fix: Application sending error and draft-saving functionality"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Deploy to server:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@185.177.216.35
   cd /root/telegram-travel-csp72-bot  # or wherever the project is
   git pull origin master
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker ps  # Check containers are running
   docker logs travel_bot --tail 50  # Check for errors
   ```

## Summary

Both critical issues have been successfully fixed:

‚úÖ **Application Sending:** Fixed by wrapping synchronous Excel generation in `asyncio.to_thread()`  
‚úÖ **Draft Saving:** Fixed by adding proper session flush and draft update logic

The draft functionality is now fully operational:
- ‚úÖ Save drafts at confirmation step
- ‚úÖ View all saved drafts
- ‚úÖ Load and continue editing drafts
- ‚úÖ Update existing drafts
- ‚úÖ Delete unwanted drafts
- ‚úÖ Convert drafts to submitted applications

All features are properly integrated with existing user interface and database schema.
